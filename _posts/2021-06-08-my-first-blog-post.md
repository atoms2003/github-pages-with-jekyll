Hi, my name is Anthony! Today is my, well... techinally my first day at KUB! I got here a little early to be honest, but it's fine. Madison, my menter, was already here and she helped me set up at my desk. I tried booting up my computer, but TECHINAL DIFFUCULTIES! It took a little time but it's up and working properly! I started with GitHub. It was a little confusing at first and I think I getting the hang of it! I hope... The first day has been pretty chill honsently. I didn't know what to expect on the first day, so this was a intresting experience! I don't really know to how to code or anything yet, but we'll get there! Umm, I don't really know to how to end a blog. Until till next time?
